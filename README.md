Initital Dijkstra's Algorithm testing.

The robot will be able to scan the shop floor for machinery, detect obstacles in it's path and find the shortest route to the machine that is low on material.

• User enters map for line-following robot via a GUI implemented in C++ or C#.
• Program figures shortest route to any machine on the shop-floor.
• Program sends instructions serially to robotic system with specific commands to get to destination.

• Robot core functionality implemented using ARM 7 LPC2119 micro-controller.
• Software implemented in C++ includes many custom algorithms including shortest-path algorithms.
• Machinery and robot interfacing using radio-frequency identification (RFID).
